SECTION 1: Who We Are

Headline: Livestock and fisheries Resource Advancement. “Where science meets sustainability, empowering farmers, researchers, vets, and policymakers with the data that build healthier and more productive animals and a safer future”

Text: We are at the forefront of creating new genomics digital platforms designed to improve the health and productivity of local animal resources. Our initial focus encompasses key livestock species: camels, sheep, cattle, chickens, horses, goats and aquatic resources in the Kingdom.

By integrating information on animal genetics with emerging health trends and epidemiological data, we aim to empower researchers, veterinarians, farmers, and policymakers with actionable insights. We aim to drive the value and sustainability of livestock in the kingdom as an asset for today and future generations.

SECTION 2: What We do - Key Insights for Healthier and productive Animals & Ecosystems

Headline: Unlocking Potential: Healthier and productive Animals, Sustainable Practices

TEXT: We aim to transform the industry in the kingdom and enable data driven economy by accelerating genetic improvement and protecting livestock and fisheries from threats of pathogens. Transforming the domain requires a strategic alignment and enablement from the national strategy of biotechnology, as NFLDP embracing biotech as the main thrust for its progress.

SECTION 3: Why It Matters - Benefits for Our Communities and the kingdom

Headline: Positive Impacts: From Farm to all. “This initiative aligns with Vision 2030 and global One Health frameworks”

Text: Our collective efforts are aimed at delivering widespread benefits

Improve Food Security and Safety: Healthier, more productive animals contribute directly to a more stable, reliable, and safe food supply for growing populations.

Empower Farmers and Producers: Provide innovative tools, data-driven insights, and knowledge resources that help farmers and aquatic producers raise healthier animals more effectively and sustainably.

Protect and Enhance Public Health: Understanding and controlling animal diseases is a cornerstone of public health, particularly for those diseases that can transfer to humans. Enabling &ldquo;One Health&rdquo; approach, recognizing the deep connections between human, animal, and environmental health.

Promote Sustainable and Efficient Practices: Genetic insights and better disease control can lead to more resource-efficient farming, reducing environmental impact, and enhancing overall sustainability.

Support Biodiversity: Genetic information helps in managing and conserving diverse animal breeds, ensuring resilience for the future.

Native Breed protection: Through genetics and bioinformatics, our assessment and preservation of native breeds is empowered and effective.

Headline: Our Vision: A Healthier Future for Livestock, Sustainable Fisheries, and Thriving Ecosystems

SECTION 1: Our Mission

Text: Our core mission is to establish and nurture a world-leading genetics and biotech powered digital resource. This will fundamentally transform how we understand, manage, and enhance the health, genetics, and productivity of Kingdom&rsquo;s livestock species (camels, sheep, cattle, chickens, horses, and goats), and fisheries.

We achieve this by:

Creating an integrated data resource: Developing a unified, interoperable platform that brings together diverse datasets – spanning genomics, phenotypes, pedigree, pathogen information, and epidemiological trends – into a comprehensive foundation for cutting-edge research and practical application. This resource will accelerate breeding and genetics improvements.

Fostering Collaboration: Designing infrastructure that naturally supports collaborative projects by offering secure, well-defined data sharing mechanisms for internal teams, external partners, and international research consortia, facilitating joint analysis and interpretation of complex global datasets.

Data Excellence (FAIR Principles): Implementing and rigorously promoting stringent data standards. We leverage established ontologies (e.g., ATO, LBO, GO) and strictly adhere to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to maximize the long-term value, discoverability, and utility of all data assets.

Delivering Advanced Analytical Power: Equipping the platform with sophisticated, user-friendly tools for genomic analysis (like variant calling, GWAS, genomic prediction), pathogen characterization (typing, antimicrobial resistance profiling), epidemiological modeling, and dynamic, interactive data visualization.

Today&rsquo;s data, Tomorrow&rsquo;s assets: Data is the new oil in a rapidly evolving economy, the digitalization of livestock of today is the key of future advancements and food security. Sustaining our genetic resources and protecting our investment and progressing steadily for better breeds, sustained agriculture and responsible developments.

SECTION 2: Who We Serve – Our Diverse Stakeholders

Text: These dynamic activities are being meticulously developed to serve a broad spectrum of users, each playing a critical role in the larger ecosystem of animal health, agriculture, and environmental stewardship:
