I'll help you build a website for animal breeding genomics and bioinformatics. Let me first examine the uploaded document to understand your specific requirements.

Based on your document and the reference site, I'll create a comprehensive website structure for your animal breeding genomics and bioinformatics platform. Here's the complete website content:

Animal Breeding Genomics & Bioinformatics Platform
Homepage
Hero Section

Headline: The Livestock and Fisheries Resource Advancement Tagline: "Where science meets sustainability, empowering farmers, researchers, vets, and policymakers with the genome and beyond to build healthier animals and a safer future"

Who We Are

We are at the forefront of creating a new genomics digital platform designed to improve the health and productivity of local animal resources. Our initial focus encompasses key livestock species: camels, sheep, cattle, chickens, horses, and goats and aquatic resources in the Kingdom.

By integrating information on animal genetics with emerging health trends and epidemiological data, we aim to empower researchers, veterinarians, farmers, and policymakers with actionable insights. We drive the value and sustainability of livestock in the kingdom as an asset for today and future generations.

What We Do - Key Insights for Healthier Animals & Ecosystems

Headline: Unlocking Potential: Healthier Animals, Sustainable Practices

Why It Matters - Benefits For Our Communities

Headline: Positive Impacts: From Farm to All "This initiative aligns with Vision 2030 and global One Health frameworks"

Our collective efforts deliver widespread benefits:

Improve Food Security and Safety: Healthier, more productive animals contribute to stable, reliable, and safe food supply
Empower Farmers and Producers: Innovative tools and data-driven insights for effective, sustainable animal raising
Protect Public Health: One Health approach recognizing connections between human, animal, and environmental health
Promote Sustainable Practices: Genetic insights leading to resource-efficient farming and reduced environmental impact
Support Biodiversity: Genetic information for managing and conserving diverse animal breeds
Native Breed Preservation: Genetics and bioinformatics for effective assessment and preservation
Success Stories

Headline: From Data to Impact
