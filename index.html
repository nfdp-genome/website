<p>We are at the forefront of creating new genomics digital platforms designed to improve the health and productivity of local animal resources. Our initial focus encompasses key livestock species: camels, sheep, cattle, chickens, horses, goats and aquatic resources in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>By integrating information on animal genetics with emerging health trends and epidemiological data, we aim to empower researchers, veterinarians, farmers, and policymakers with actionable insights. We aim to drive the value and sustainability of livestock in the kingdom as an asset for today and future generations.</p></div>

<p>TEXT: We aim to transform the industry in the kingdom and enable data driven economy by accelerating genetic improvement and protecting livestock and fisheries from threats of pathogens. Transforming the domain requires a strategic alignment and enablement from the national strategy of biotechnology, as NFLDP embracing biotech as the main thrust for its progress.</p></div>

            <div class="content-container" id="why-it-matters-content"><h2>Positive Impacts: From Farm to all. “This initiative aligns with Vision 2030 and global One Health frameworks”</h2>
<p>Our collective efforts are aimed at delivering widespread benefits</p>
<p>Improve Food Security and Safety: Healthier, more productive animals contribute directly to a more stable, reliable, and safe food supply for growing populations.
Empower Farmers and Producers: Provide innovative tools, data-driven insights, and knowledge resources that help farmers and aquatic producers raise healthier animals more effectively and sustainably.
Protect and Enhance Public Health: Understanding and controlling animal diseases is a cornerstone of public health, particularly for those diseases that can transfer to humans. Enabling &ldquo;One Health&rdquo; approach, recognizing the deep connections between human, animal, and environmental health.
Promote Sustainable and Efficient Practices: Genetic insights and better disease control can lead to more resource-efficient farming, reducing environmental impact, and enhancing overall sustainability.
Support Biodiversity: Genetic information helps in managing and conserving diverse animal breeds, ensuring resilience for the future.
Native Breed protection: Through genetics and bioinformatics, our assessment and preservation of native breeds is empowered and effective.</p></div>
