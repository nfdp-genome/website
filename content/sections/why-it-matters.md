### Positive Impacts: From Farm to all. “This initiative aligns with Vision 2030 and global One Health frameworks”

Our collective efforts are aimed at delivering widespread benefits:

**Improve Food Security and Safety:** Healthier, more productive animals contribute directly to a more stable, reliable, and safe food supply for growing populations.

**Empower Farmers and Producers:** Provide innovative tools, data-driven insights, and knowledge resources that help farmers and aquatic producers raise healthier animals more effectively and sustainably.

**Protect and Enhance Public Health:** Understanding and controlling animal diseases is a cornerstone of public health, particularly for those diseases that can transfer to humans. Enabling “One Health” approach, recognizing the deep connections between human, animal, and environmental health.

**Promote Sustainable and Efficient Practices:** Genetic insights and better disease control can lead to more resource-efficient farming, reducing environmental impact, and enhancing overall sustainability.

**Support Biodiversity:** Genetic information helps in managing and conserving diverse animal breeds, ensuring resilience for the future.

**Native Breed protection:** Through genetics and bioinformatics, our assessment and preservation of native breeds is empowered and effective.
