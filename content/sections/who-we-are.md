### Livestock and fisheries Resource Advancement. “Where science meets sustainability, empowering farmers, researchers, vets, and policymakers with the data that build healthier and more productive animals and a safer future”

We are at the forefront of creating new genomics digital platforms designed to improve the health and productivity of local animal resources. Our initial focus encompasses key livestock species: camels, sheep, cattle, chickens, horses, goats and aquatic resources in the Kingdom.

By integrating information on animal genetics with emerging health trends and epidemiological data, we aim to empower researchers, veterinarians, farmers, and policymakers with actionable insights. We aim to drive the value and sustainability of livestock in the kingdom as an asset for today and future generations.
